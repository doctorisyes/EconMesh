# EconMesh
**Description**

My EPQ Project - An agent-based economic simulator, with a focus on experimenting with macroeconomic policies.

**Progress**

Currently, the simulation part of the simulator is missing. However, the key economic agents (consumers, firms and the government) have been made, as well as the simple ways they interact with each other. The key thing missing from this project is to actually create a mesh of interconnected nodes actually in the program, but for now, the seperate nodes have had a start.

The first draft of the EPQ has to be submitted by the 28 February 2025, and therfore I hope a considerable amount is done by then.
