**Description**

An agent-based economic simulator, with a focus on experimenting with macroeconomic policies.

**Progress**

For the most part, most of the core actions that economic agents have in the real world have been recreated with methods within their corresponding classes.
However, these actions need to be taken automatically, with the economic agents acting independently without user-input unless the user wants to interviene with an economic policy.
Currently, economic agents are capable of identifying the economy's needs and wants and demanding and supplying goods accordingly. However, they are not yet capable of making economic decisions.

The first draft of the EPQ has to be submitted by the 28 February 2025, and therfore I hope a considerable amount is done by then.
